# Personal Hobby Projects
Just a repository of various personal projects, nothing nefarious here, I swear!

In this repository, you, the web browsing person will find a small array of software which is generally
only useful to me, and will require modification for the use of others.  None of these projects follow
any UX standards or guidelines, and some of these projects really do test what we all use as a standard
user interface, but most of these projects should be easy enough to use once you compile and try them
out for yourself, if you are curious about how they work, and/or you believe you might find some
personal use from them yourself.  I did give all the source code in this repository a very permissive
license, so feel free to use the source code as per the included license file.  I hope that these
projects can help someone else as they have helped me.

## System Manager

A single PC replacement for my past *Device Manager* program which as the name implies, manages more
than one device, which can be a server, desktop, workstation, laptop, smartphone, tablet, etc...  Since
I no longer have my expansive home automation system with a large array of devices, I decided to make
a new type of program for managing mostly local virtual systems in the most efficient way I could
create at the time I wrote this program.
